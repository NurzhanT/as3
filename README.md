# Assignment: Data Structures Implementation

## Part 1.1: Implementing MyHashTable Class

### Description:
In this part of the assignment, you are required to implement the MyHashTable class. This class will serve as a basic hash table data structure.

### Instructions:
- Implement the MyHashTable class according to the provided specifications.
- Ensure that the class provides functionalities for adding, removing, and retrieving elements.
- Pay attention to handling collisions using chaining or linked lists.

## Part 1.2: Testing

### Instructions:
- Create an additional class for testing, e.g., MyHashTableTest.
- Define a MyTestingClass to be used as keys in the hash table.
- Implement a custom hashCode() method for MyTestingClass (avoid using default hashing methods like Objects.hash()).
- Add 10,000 random elements to your hash table and print the number of elements in each bucket.
- Tune the hashCode method in MyTestingClass to ensure uniform distribution.

## Part 2.1: Implementing Binary Search Tree Class

### Instructions:
- Implement the BinarySearchTree class according to the provided specifications.
- Ensure that the class provides functionalities for adding, removing, and retrieving elements.
- Implement methods for size calculation, in-order traversal, and iterator support.

## Part 2.2: Enhancements for Binary Search Tree

### Instructions:
 **Add Size**:
   - Implement a method to calculate and return the size of the binary search tree.
   
 **Implement In-order Traversal for Iterator()**:
   - Modify the iterator to support in-order traversal of the binary search tree.

 **Accessibility of Key-Value Pairs during Iteration**:
   - Enhance the iterator to provide access to both key and value pairs during iteration.
